This is my first post. In a tradition from times that may have since passed, it is a 'Hello World' post. I have spent numerous hours figuring out Jekyll –after some time messing around with Pelican– and now I finally have something to post.

Jekyll was easy to install but annoying to customize (as a novice). I set it up with as git repository connected to Github pages. That was painless. The problem was when Jekyll uses the Gem for building the template, it foregoes downloading all the directories. This meant that customizations required creating the directories manually. This was not a big deal but was something I had to figure out. I forked the template on Github, downloaded the 2.5 stable version branch of the template, and copied over the additional directories to the site's folder.

Now that that's done: Hello World!
