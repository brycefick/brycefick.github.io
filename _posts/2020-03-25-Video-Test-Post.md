This post is meant to test adding video. It is a video of a small waterfall of a creek at the Auburn State Recreation Area

Update: March 26, 2020, 22:11.
The test failed. The photo worked at first, then it stopped after the next change. Github Pages did not seem like the place that would give away free media hosting. It was worth a shot. (I also did not bother to check any of the documentation.) I am leaving the code here to remind myself what I did.
